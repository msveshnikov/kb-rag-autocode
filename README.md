# AI-Driven Knowledge Base for Customer Service (build by [AutoCode](https://autocode.work) in 20 minutes)

## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced AI-driven knowledge base designed to assist customer service agents in a large financial institution. It leverages Claude 3.5 AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and various microservices to provide accurate, efficient, and compliant responses across multiple communication channels.

### Key Features

-   Natural language querying for agents
-   Comprehensive coverage of business rules, norms, and processes
-   Regular updates and legal vetting of content
-   Multi-language support with cultural nuance preservation
-   Integration with existing customer service tools
-   Confidence scoring and hallucination prevention
-   Caching for improved performance
-   Analytics and feedback mechanisms
-   Scalable and secure architecture

## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture, with the main application server orchestrating various specialized services:

1. **Main Application Server (index.js)**: Central coordination point for request handling and service orchestration.
2. **Claude AI Service (claude.js)**: Interfaces with Claude 3.5 for NLP and response generation.
3. **RAG Service (rag.js)**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation for enhanced accuracy.
4. **Prompt Cache (promptCache.js)**: Caches frequent queries for improved performance.
5. **Database Service (database.js)**: Manages secure storage and retrieval of vetted information.
6. **Translation Service (translation.js)**: Handles multi-language support and cultural nuances.
7. **Confidence Scorer (confidenceScorer.js)**: Evaluates response reliability.
8. **Analytics Service (analytics.js)**: Tracks usage and generates insights.
9. **Feedback Service (feedback.js)**: Manages agent feedback for continuous improvement.

## Module Interactions

1. Query received → Check prompt cache
2. If not cached → RAG service retrieves relevant information
3. Claude AI generates response based on query, retrieved info, and context
4. Confidence scorer evaluates response quality
5. Low confidence → Return fallback message
6. Non-English queries → Translation service used before/after AI processing
7. Successful responses cached
8. All interactions logged by analytics service
9. Agents provide feedback via feedback service

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up environment variables in `.env` file
4. Start development server: `npm run dev`
5. For production: `npm start`

## API Endpoints

-   POST `/query`: Submit a query
-   POST `/feedback`: Submit feedback
-   GET `/analytics`: Retrieve analytics report

## Security and Compliance

-   Helmet for HTTP security headers
-   Authentication required for all endpoints
-   CORS configured for approved origins
-   Secure storage of sensitive data
-   GDPR, CCPA, and regulatory compliance

## Testing, Linting, and Formatting

-   Run tests: `npm test`
-   Lint code: `npm run lint`
-   Format code: `npm run format`

## New Design Considerations

1. **Adaptive Learning System**

    - Implement machine learning algorithms to continuously improve response accuracy based on feedback and usage patterns

2. **Context-Aware Personalization**

    - Develop a system to tailor responses based on customer history, preferences, and current interaction context

3. **Proactive Issue Resolution**

    - Create predictive models to identify potential customer issues before they escalate

4. **Voice and Sentiment Analysis**

    - Integrate voice recognition and sentiment analysis for enhanced customer understanding in voice channels

5. **Blockchain for Audit Trail**

    - Implement a blockchain-based system for maintaining an immutable audit trail of all knowledge base updates and usage

6. **AI-Powered Visual Assistance**

    - Develop capabilities to process and respond to image-based queries for visual product support

7. **Gamification for Agent Training**

    - Create a gamified learning system to incentivize and improve agent knowledge and performance

8. **Dynamic Knowledge Graph**

    - Implement a self-updating knowledge graph to visualize and manage complex relationships within the knowledge base

9. **Federated Learning for Privacy**

    - Explore federated learning techniques to improve AI models while preserving data privacy

10. **Explainable AI Integration**

    - Incorporate explainable AI techniques to provide reasoning behind AI-generated responses

11. **Real-Time Language Model Fine-Tuning**

    - Develop a system for continuous fine-tuning of language models based on new data and feedback

12. **Multi-Modal Response Generation**
    - Extend the system to generate responses in various formats (text, images, videos) based on query type and channel
