# AI-Driven Knowledge Base for Customer Service

## Overview

This project implements a powerful AI-driven knowledge base (KB) to assist customer service agents in providing accurate and efficient responses across multiple channels (voice, email, chat) for a large financial institution with multiple lines of business.

## Key Features

-   Natural language querying for agents
-   Comprehensive coverage of business rules, norms, and processes
-   Regular updates and legal vetting of content
-   Multi-language support
-   Integration with existing customer service tools
-   Analytics and performance tracking
-   Feedback loop for continuous improvement

## Technology Stack

-   Claude 3.5 for AI processing
-   ES6, async/await, fetch (no axios)
-   RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for improved accuracy
-   Prompt caching for faster response times
-   Secure database for storing vetted information

## Design Considerations

1. Data Quality Assurance

    - Implement a rigorous content validation process
    - Establish a team for continuous content curation and updates

2. Hallucination Prevention

    - Utilize confidence scoring system (confidenceScorer.js)
    - Implement human-in-the-loop verification for low-confidence answers

3. User Experience

    - Create an intuitive interface for agents to query the KB
    - Provide context-aware suggestions based on customer interaction history

4. Performance Optimization

    - Implement caching mechanisms (promptCache.js)
    - Use distributed computing for handling high query volumes

5. Security and Compliance

    - Ensure GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulatory compliance
    - Implement role-based access control for sensitive information

6. Multi-Language Support

    - Utilize translation.js for machine translation services
    - Maintain language-specific knowledge bases for cultural nuances

7. Integration Capabilities

    - Develop APIs for seamless integration with existing CRM systems
    - Create plugins for popular customer service platforms

8. Analytics and Reporting

    - Use analytics.js for usage tracking and performance metrics
    - Provide insights on common customer queries and agent performance

9. Feedback Loop

    - Incorporate agent feedback using feedback.js
    - Implement a voting system for answer quality

10. Scalability

    - Design a microservices architecture for easy scaling
    - Utilize cloud infrastructure for flexible resource allocation

11. AI Model Management

    - Implement versioning for Claude models (claude.js)
    - Set up A/B testing for different AI configurations

12. Knowledge Graph Integration

    - Explore integration of knowledge graphs for enhanced context understanding
    - Implement entity linking and relationship mapping

13. Real-time Collaboration

    - Develop features for agents to share and collaborate on complex queries
    - Implement a system for escalating issues to subject matter experts

14. Customization and Personalization

    - Allow for company-specific customization of the knowledge base
    - Implement agent-specific preferences and learning paths

15. Ethical AI Considerations
    - Develop guidelines for responsible AI use in customer service
    - Implement bias detection and mitigation strategies
