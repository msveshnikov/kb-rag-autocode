# AI-Driven Knowledge Base Server Documentation

## Overview

This file (`index.js`) serves as the main entry point for an AI-Driven Knowledge Base server built with Express.js. It integrates various services to handle queries, provide AI-generated responses, manage caching, perform analytics, and collect user feedback.

The server implements a RESTful API with endpoints for querying the knowledge base, submitting feedback, and retrieving analytics reports. It uses middleware for authentication, request validation, and error handling.

## Dependencies

- Express.js: Web application framework
- Helmet: Security middleware
- Compression: Response compression middleware
- CORS: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing middleware
- dotenv: Environment variable management

## Imported Services

- Claude: AI processing service
- RAG: Retrieval-Augmented Generation service
- PromptCache: Caching service for AI responses
- Database: Database interaction service
- TranslationService: Language translation service
- ConfidenceScorer: AI response confidence scoring service
- AnalyticsService: Query and response analytics service
- FeedbackService: User feedback management service

## Middleware

- `authenticate`: User authentication middleware
- `validateQuery`: Query validation middleware
- `validateFeedback`: Feedback validation middleware
- `errorHandler`: Global error handling middleware

## Server Configuration

```javascript
const app = express();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

app.use(helmet());
app.use(compression());
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());
```

The server is configured with security headers (Helmet), response compression, CORS support, and JSON body parsing.

## API Endpoints

### POST /query

Processes user queries and returns AI-generated responses.

#### Parameters
- `query` (string): The user's question or query
- `language` (string): The language of the query (default: 'en')
- `context` (object): Additional context for the query

#### Process
1. Translates the query to English if necessary
2. Checks for a cached response
3. Retrieves relevant information using RAG
4. Generates an AI response using Claude
5. Scores the confidence of the response
6. Translates the response back to the original language if necessary
7. Caches the response for future use
8. Tracks the query and response for analytics

#### Response
- `response` (string): The AI-generated answer
- `confidence` (number): Confidence score of the response
- `source` (string): Indicates whether the response came from cache or AI

### POST /feedback

Submits user feedback for a specific query.

#### Parameters
- `queryId` (string): Identifier for the query
- `rating` (number): User rating for the response
- `comment` (string): Optional user comment

#### Response
Confirmation message for successful feedback submission

### GET /analytics

Retrieves analytics reports.

#### Response
JSON object containing analytics data

## Error Handling

The server uses a global error handler middleware to catch and process any errors that occur during request processing.

## Usage

To start the server:

```javascript
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`AI-Driven Knowledge Base server running on port ${port}`);
});
```

## Exporting

The `app` object is exported as the default export, allowing it to be imported and used in other parts of the project, such as for testing purposes.

```javascript
export default app;
```

## Project Structure

This file (`index.js`) is the main entry point for the application. It integrates services from the `services/` directory and middleware from the `middleware/` directory (not shown in the provided structure but referenced in the code).

The modular structure allows for easy maintenance and scalability of the different components of the AI-Driven Knowledge Base system.
