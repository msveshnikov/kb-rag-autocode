# AI-Driven Knowledge Base for Customer Service

## Project Overview

This project implements an advanced AI-driven knowledge base designed to assist customer service agents in a large financial institution. It leverages Claude 3.5 AI, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and various microservices to provide accurate, efficient, and compliant responses across multiple communication channels.

### Key Features

-   Natural language querying for agents
-   Comprehensive coverage of business rules, norms, and processes
-   Regular updates and legal vetting of content
-   Multi-language support
-   Integration with existing customer service tools
-   Confidence scoring and hallucination prevention
-   Caching for improved performance
-   Analytics and feedback mechanisms
-   Scalable and secure architecture

## Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture, with the main application server orchestrating various specialized services. Here's an overview of the key components:

1. **Main Application Server (index.js)**: Acts as the central coordination point, handling HTTP requests, authentication, and orchestrating other services.

2. **Claude AI Service (claude.js)**: Interfaces with the Claude 3.5 AI model for natural language processing and response generation.

3. **RAG Service (rag.js)**: Implements Retrieval-Augmented Generation to enhance response accuracy by retrieving relevant information.

4. **Prompt Cache (promptCache.js)**: Caches frequently asked questions and their responses for improved performance.

5. **Database Service (database.js)**: Manages the secure storage and retrieval of vetted information.

6. **Translation Service (translation.js)**: Handles multi-language support through machine translation.

7. **Confidence Scorer (confidenceScorer.js)**: Evaluates the reliability of AI-generated responses.

8. **Analytics Service (analytics.js)**: Tracks usage, performance metrics, and generates insights.

9. **Feedback Service (feedback.js)**: Manages the collection and processing of agent feedback for continuous improvement.

## Module Interactions

1. When a query is received, the main server first checks the prompt cache for a quick response.
2. If not cached, the query is processed by the RAG service to retrieve relevant information.
3. The Claude AI service then generates a response based on the query, retrieved information, and context.
4. The confidence scorer evaluates the response quality.
5. If the confidence is low, a fallback message is returned.
6. For non-English queries, the translation service is used before and after AI processing.
7. Successful responses are cached for future use.
8. All interactions are logged by the analytics service.
9. Agents can provide feedback, which is processed by the feedback service.

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ai-driven-knowledge-base.git
    cd ai-driven-knowledge-base
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    CLAUDE_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key
    DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
    REDIS_URL=your_redis_url
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

4. Start the development server:

    ```
    npm run dev
    ```

5. For production, use:
    ```
    npm start
    ```

## API Endpoints

-   POST `/query`: Submit a query to the knowledge base

    -   Required headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    -   Body: `{ "query": "string", "language": "string", "context": "object" }`

-   POST `/feedback`: Submit feedback for a query

    -   Required headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`
    -   Body: `{ "queryId": "string", "rating": "number", "comment": "string" }`

-   GET `/analytics`: Retrieve analytics report
    -   Required headers: `Authorization: Bearer <token>`

## Security and Compliance

-   The application uses Helmet for setting various HTTP headers for security.
-   Authentication is required for all endpoints.
-   CORS is configured to restrict access to approved origins.
-   Sensitive data is stored securely in the database.
-   The system is designed to comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant regulations.

## Testing
